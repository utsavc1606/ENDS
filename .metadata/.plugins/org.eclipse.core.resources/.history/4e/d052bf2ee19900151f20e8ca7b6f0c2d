This program filters takes the output from Step 2 as input (AllTweetsNoRtTag.txt) and creates two output files unwantedTweets.txt and 
unwantedTweetsWithFrequency.txt. The first output file is simply a list of all suspected spam tweets as per our filter and 
the second output file contains the tweet frequency of each spam tweet from the whole data set.
